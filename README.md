# Password-Vault
A Python based GUI application that would first authenticate yourself with master password
and further to that will show all the saved password. You can add new passwords in the same screen.
It would save in the format name - email - password. 

To make it more secure, all the entities (name, email, password) would be encrypted and saved in a
file. Every time when the file is read it would decrypt the text.
